3.	What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?

Ans. Asynchronous does not respond immediately, while Non-blocking responds immediately if the data is available 
and if not that simply returns an error.
        
Asynchronous improves the efficiency by doing the task fast as the response might come
later, meanwhile, can do other tasks, while Non-blocking does not block any execution and if the data is available it retrieves the information quickly.
