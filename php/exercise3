Question :::
    Assume you have this associative array:

    array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");

    Write a brief sample code that loops through it and prints the name, age.



Ans :::
<?php
$myAge = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");

foreach($myAge as $key => $val) {
        echo $key;
        echo $val;
}
?>
