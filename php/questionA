a.	Whatâ€™s the difference between the include() and require() functions?

ANS: 
You can't selectively load only the pieces you need with require but with import, you can selectively load only the pieces you need, which can save memory.
Loading is synchronous(step by step) for require on the other hand import can be asynchronous(without waiting for previous import) so it can perform a little better than require.
