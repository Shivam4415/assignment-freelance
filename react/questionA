a.	What is the difference between state and props?

Ans: 
State
    The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system event. 
    It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render. 
    It represents the component's local state or information. 
    It can only be accessed or modified inside the component or by the component directly.
    Props
    props are read-only components. 
    It allows passing data from one component to other components. 
    It is similar to function arguments and can be passed to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function. 
    Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component.
