b.	What are synthetic events in React? (Provide an example)

Ans :: 
A synthetic event is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. 
It has the same interface as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault() , 
    except the events work identically across all browsers
