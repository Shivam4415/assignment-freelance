c. What are portals in React?


Portal in react is a first-class way to render child components into a DOM node outside of the parent DOM hierarchy 
defined by the component tree hierarchy. The Portal's most common use cases are when the child components need to visually 
break out of the parent container of modal dialog boxes, tooltips, hovercards and loaders.
